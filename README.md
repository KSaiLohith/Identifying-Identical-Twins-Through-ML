# Identifying-Identical-Twins-Through-ML
The project aims to develop a robust machine learning (ML) solution for identifying identical twins from various datasets. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the system will analyze biological, genetic, and phenotypic data to distinguish between identical twins and non-identical individuals.
